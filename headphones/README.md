## 📝 Project Description

This is a project for the **ALX Front-End curriculum**. The goal is to implement a web page **from scratch** using **only HTML and CSS**, following the **Figma design** created by **Nicolas Philippot**.  
The page must match the design **exactly**, be fully **responsive**, and **accessible**, without using any CSS frameworks or JavaScript.

## 🎨 Figma Design

The design has been successfully duplicated into my Figma account.
